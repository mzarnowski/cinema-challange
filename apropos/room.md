# Room Schedule
- A room operates during a continuous block of time decided by the cinema.
- room manages the movies it displays
- No two shows can overlap the same period of time
- the room must be cleaned after every show
- cleaning time can vary between the rooms


## Assumptions:
### the operating hours are a continuous block of time
### every day, room operates within the same hours
### the operating hours cannot be changed
#### Questions:
- what, if there is e.g. a spillage or malfunction?
### cleaning can be done after operating hours
