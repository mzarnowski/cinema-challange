# Provisions
A special requirement, e.g. for the movie.

For example, a 3D-glasses are such provision. 

## Assumptions
### Provisions are always available
If that weren't the case, we would need to probably verify their availability when scheduling a show.
Requesting them would then require extending the consistency boundary on a room schedule and provision stockpile.
### Movie provisions are passed through
It means that when the show is scheduled, they are part of the resulting event to be picked-up by 
other parties
